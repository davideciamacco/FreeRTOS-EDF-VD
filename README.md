## Overview

The implementation focuses on the scenario with **k=2 criticality levels** and is designed to work on an STM32 microcontroller. It leverages:

- **FreeRTOS** as the real-time operating system 
- **STM32CubeMX-generated code** for project initialization (CMSIS middleware has being removed)
- **Target board**: STM32 NUCLEO-H533RE

The core logic involves handling real-time tasks with two levels of criticality, managing mode switches, and ensuring schedulability under the assumptions and models defined in the original paper.

## Steps for the Autogenerated Code (first commit):

1. **Create a New Project**  
   Begin by creating a new project for the NUCLEO-H533RE.

2. **Deselect Unnecessary Components**  
   During the project setup, unselect the following components:
   - Human Machine Interface (HMI)
   - User LED Green
   - User Button
   - Virtual COM Port

3. **First Code Generation**  
   Generate the initial code to configure the project.

4. **Modify TimeBase Source**  
   Change the TimeBase source to **TIM6** for the required timing functions.

5. **Enable Debugging with Trace Asynchronous SW**  
   Enable debugging and configure trace with asynchronous software support.

6. **Enable X-CUBE-FREERTOS**  
   Enable **X-CUBE-FREERTOS** and configure the following:
   - **Core**: Set to `TZ_Non_Supported`
   - **Heap**: Set to `Heap_4`
